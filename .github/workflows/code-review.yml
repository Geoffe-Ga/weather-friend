          # Security: Restrict Claude to read-only GitHub CLI commands
          # Wildcard patterns (e.g., "gh pr view:*") allow any arguments to the specified command
          # but the action enforces read-only permissions (pull-requests: read, issues: read)
          # preventing write operations even if attempted.
          #
          # Note: gh pr comment is the ONLY write operation allowed and is required for
          # Claude to post automated review results as PR comments. All other commands
          # are read-only (view, list, diff, search).
          #
          # See https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/docs/usage.md
          # for allowed-tools syntax and security model.
